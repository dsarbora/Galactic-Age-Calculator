## Galactic Age Calculator
#### By Dave Sarbora
#### To calculate your age on other planets.
## Description

This application takes a user's age and determines how old they would be on other planets in the solar system. Additionally, it will tell you how much longer you have left to live based on a preset oversimplified and unrealistic life expectancy of 100 years.

## Specifications

The input/output of this program is very simple. A user will input a date, and the user's age and remaining life expectancy on many different planets will be outputted.
**All ages will be truncated as they generally are here on Earth.**
Therefore, if a particular user is **52.8** years old on Mercury, they will be treated as **52** years old.
Just as if a user is **20.997** years old on Earth, they are **20** years old.
For example:

For the input:

|input |    |
|-----:|:---|
|Day:  |23  |
|Month:|5   |
|Year: |1995|

We expect the output:

|Planet  |Current Age  |Years Until Death |
|-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------|
|Mercury |95           |320               |
|Venus   |37           |124               |
|Earth   |23           |77                |
|Mars    |12           |40                |
|Jupiter |1            |6                 |
